You are implementing exchange integration and documentation for a crypto quantitative trading system.

**Project Location:** /Users/sunny/.openclaw/workspace/crypto-trader/

**Your Tasks:**
1. Read `/Users/sunny/.openclaw/workspace/crypto-trader/CODEX_SPEC.md` thoroughly
2. Implement ALL items listed in the spec
3. Follow the code style and structure already established in the project
4. Create a professional, minimal README.md (NOT AI-generated looking - see spec for style guide)

**Key Constraints:**
- Use CCXT library for exchange connectivity
- Start with Coinbase Advanced Trade (paper/sandbox mode)
- Never commit API keys - use .env file
- Keep existing code working - don't break the current models
- Paper trading only - no live execution yet

**Implementation Order:**
1. Exchange connector (`src/execution/exchange.py`)
2. Update data fetcher to support exchange data
3. Add exchange config to `config.yaml`
4. Create `.env.example` template
5. Update `requirements.txt`
6. Write professional README.md
7. Create paper trading script (`scripts/run_paper.py`)

**Testing:**
After each major component, run the existing test dashboard to make sure nothing broke:
```bash
cd /Users/sunny/.openclaw/workspace/crypto-trader
python3 test_dashboard.py
```

**README Style:**
- Clear, minimal sections
- No excessive emoji or hype language
- Professional tone (production trading system, not a demo)
- Code examples where helpful
- Real installation/setup instructions
- Proper disclaimers about risk

When you're done, provide a summary of what was implemented and where to find the key files.
