Implement Option A: Hybrid Deep Learning + Reinforcement Learning Architecture for crypto trading.

Full technical specification: See CODEX_SPEC_OPTION_A.md in this directory.

Key requirements:
1. Create 5 new model files:
   - src/models/temporal_fusion_transformer.py (TFT for multi-horizon forecasting)
   - src/models/lstm_cnn_hybrid.py (Pattern recognition + sequential)
   - src/models/sentiment_analyzer.py (Placeholder for now)
   - src/models/reinforcement_learning.py (PPO agent)
   - src/models/enhanced_ensemble.py (Intelligent signal fusion)

2. Create training pipeline:
   - scripts/train_deep_models.py (main orchestrator)
   - Support --mode full/quick/resume
   - Comprehensive logging to logs/training/
   - Save checkpoints to checkpoints/ directory

3. Update existing files:
   - requirements.txt (add PyTorch, pytorch-forecasting, stable-baselines3, etc.)
   - config.yaml (add deep_learning section)
   - src/models/__init__.py (export new models)

4. Integration requirements:
   - Must work with existing data fetcher (src/data/fetcher.py)
   - Generate signals compatible with current dashboard format
   - Use M4 Mac GPU (Metal Performance Shaders - "mps" device)
   - Graceful fallback to CPU if GPU unavailable

5. Training parameters:
   - TFT: 100 epochs, 3-4 hour training time
   - LSTM-CNN: 50 epochs, 1-2 hour training time  
   - RL Agent: 500k timesteps, 2-4 hour training time
   - Total: 6-12 hours for full training

6. Code quality:
   - PyTorch best practices
   - Modular, clean code
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Verbose logging for monitoring
   - Type hints
   - Docstrings for all classes/methods

Please read CODEX_SPEC_OPTION_A.md for complete architectural details, then implement all components.

Start with the model files, then the training script, then integration updates.
